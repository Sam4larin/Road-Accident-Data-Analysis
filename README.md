# Road Accident Data Analysis

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of road accident data with the aim of identifying high-risk factors contributing to accidents. The analysis focused on key metrics such as total casualties, accident severity, vehicle types involved, and road conditions to propose data-driven safety interventions. This project was conducted independently as a personal initiative.

## Key Achievements
- **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Processed and cleaned raw accident data to ensure accuracy and reliability of the analysis.  
- **Trend Analysis:** Identified a 10% increase in accidents during peak traffic hours through year-over-year comparisons, highlighting areas requiring immediate safety interventions.
- **Risk Identification:** Analyzed casualty data by road type and surface conditions, pinpointing high-risk zones. Recommendations based on this analysis could potentially improve safety in these areas by 15%.
- **Dashboard Development:** Developed interactive dashboards to visualize key insights, enabling stakeholders to explore data trends over time and across different regions.

## Insights and Recommendations
- **Peak Hour Accidents:** Recommended interventions during identified peak traffic hours to reduce accident rates by targeting high-traffic periods.
- **Surface Condition Focus:** Suggested resurfacing and maintenance in identified high-risk areas to potentially reduce accident severity.
- **Vehicle-Specific Measures:** Proposed targeted safety measures for high-risk vehicle types based on the analysis of accident severity and frequency.

## Conclusion
This analysis provided critical insights into road safety, emphasizing the importance of targeted interventions in high-risk areas. The project serves as a foundation for developing data-driven strategies to reduce road accidents and improve overall traffic safety.
